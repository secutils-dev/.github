## Why Secutils.dev?

Big security solutions are impressive, but often too expensive, complex, and kind of overkill for us regular engineers. On the other hand, there's a bunch of handy tools and scripts tackling specific security problems - they're simple and affordable, but trying to juggle them is hard and messy. Secutils.dev aims to be the sweet spot between hefty solutions and scattered tools. It's open, user-friendly, and your go-to toolbox filled with carefully selected utilities commonly used in daily work, whether you're operating solo or part of a big team.

Secutils.dev adheres to [open security principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_security) and offers:
* Guided experience for complex security concepts
* [Request responders](https://secutils.dev/docs/guides/webhooks) for rapid mocking of HTTP APIs and webhooks
* [Templates](https://secutils.dev/docs/guides/digital_certificates) for certificates and private keys to test cryptographic security protocols
* [Content Security Policy (CSP) management](https://secutils.dev/docs/guides/web_security/csp), enabling the import and creation of policies from scratch
* Tools for [web page resource scraping](https://secutils.dev/docs/guides/web_scraping/resources), content tracking, and more
